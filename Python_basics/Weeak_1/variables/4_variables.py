#Variable Types and Dynamic Typing
#Python is dynamically typed - you don't need to declare variable types.

# Variable can change type
x = 10          # x is integer
print(type(x))  # <class 'int'>

x = "Hello"     # x is now string
print(type(x))  # <class 'str'>

x = 3.14        # x is now float
print(type(x))  # <class 'float'>
